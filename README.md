# Starting Up
A project that is aimed at decision making of startup companies.


## Gotchas in Development
1. Visualization
   There is some weird glitch effects when the user first enter a section. The charts visualization
   is not animated when the charts come with the next section button, e.g., when the charts is the
   last frame of a section.

2. Back-end
   The deployed web app is sending back-end API requests to localhost:1337. This is meant to avoid
   exploitation of the API and database. If anyone wants to test out this project, please also clone
   the back-end from `starting-up-backend` and configure the database. An local MongoDB database
   will do the job.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## Collaboration
If anyone wants to extend this project, DM me with your background so that we can discuss the
possible use cases where the project can be applied to.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

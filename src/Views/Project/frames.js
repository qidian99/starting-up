          In this section we'll first interpret the slope and intercept and then discuss how to find the exact slope and intercept that explains the relationship between our X and Y the best.`,

    As you might have already noticed, the answer to this equation is not y, but rather ŷ. This is because y refers to the actual y value that we get from the data points. ŷ refers to the prediction that our regression line makes. This distinction becomes important later on.`,
